# StudySync

## Product Vision Statement 
StudySync is a student-focused web application designed to help college and university students find compatible study partners within their courses. By matching students based on shared classes, availability, study preferences, and preferred study locations, StudySync simplifies the process of forming effective and consistent study partnerships.

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of StudySync will provide just enough functionality for early adopters to create profiles, receive basic study partner matches, and connect with matched peers. The goal of the MVP is to deliver a usable, intuitive experience that enables students to find at least one compatible study partner without friction.

By releasing a focused MVP early, StudySync enables rapid user feedback, minimizes unnecessary features, and prevents scope creep. This clear product vision helps the development team align on priorities, understand their responsibilities, and concentrate on delivering core value rather than building a fully polished product prematurely.

## Project Background 
StudySync was created as a student driven project to address the challenge many college students face when trying to find compatible study partners in large and busy academic environments. The idea originated from personal experiences of struggling to coordinate study sessions with peers who had different schedules, learning styles, or expectations. We hope that this project grow into an intentional effort to design a practical and user-centered tool that promotes collaboration and academic success.
