# User Experience Design

## Prototype

[Link to our Prototype(Work in Progress)](https://www.figma.com/proto/vhaXeZWN56qasJLh5cQQqY/Study-Sync---Team-Triplewise-Wireframe?node-id=2-8&p=f&t=TiBj1gnKE1qGqttx-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2) 

## App Map
Attached below is our App Map for Study Sync. Users are initially greeted with a welcome page, where they will be prompted to either sign in, or create an account. Signing in leads them straight to their dashboard, where they can view their profile, view meetings, and view their matches. Each of those items resides as a link to a following page giving more detail. 

Creating an account leads to an account creation page, allowing a user to add all of their classes and times, their preferred study locations, and their preferred study habits. These may include working quietly together, engaging in constructive discussion, and more.

## Wireframe
(We are aware of mistakes in the wireframe, and will be fixing them ASAP.)

The first diagram in our wireframe is a welcome page showing a graphic, along with the options to log in or sign up.

The second Diagram shows the Account Creation page. This is where the user can input their chosen username and password, and it continues to required information in the next diagram.

The third diagram is the final part of account creation. This is where the user gets their first opportunity to add all of their classes and class times, as well as their preferred study locations and study methods. The page ends with a button that completes account creation.

Going back a bit, this next diagram is a simple login page, prompting the user to input their username and password if they already have an account. 

![Login Page](<ux-design/iPhone 16 & 17 Pro Max - 2.png>)

Both the Login Page and the Account creation page lead to the Student Sync Dashboard, where the user is able to see upcoming meetings, meeting requests they have, and links to finding study partner matches and to organize meetings. Pressing the Profile icon on the top right will also lead to the user's profile.

Pressing on the Find New Matches button of the dashboard leads to a page full of potential study partner matches for the user. These will be sorted by % matching by default, however the user will have the ability to sort and filter these matches based on criteria of their selection, such as seeking only those that like studying at Bobst. Clicking on a matches' profile will lead to their profile, where more information can be gained.

On this following diagram, the user can view a bunch of information based on one of their matches. This info will include their current classes, preferred study locations and methods, along with a button to set up a meeting or send a message to the match.

This diagram outlines the "Organize Study Sync" option of the User's dashboard. This page allows the user to select and organize a meeting, as well as showing their upcoming and past meetings.

The final part of the User Dashboard is the profile icon in the top right of the page. This profile icon leads to the user profile page, where several things can be done. Class schedules, preferred study locations and methods, as well as user profile details can all be edited in this page. These diagrams are laid out below.

![Edit Page 3](<ux-design/iPhone 16 & 17 Pro Max - 10.png>)
![Edit Page 4](<ux-design/iPhone 16 & 17 Pro Max - 9.png>)

Now, the last diagram is simply a "check" screen, that displays a success when creating/setting up a meeting request. It is displayed below.
